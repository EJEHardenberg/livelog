LiveLog is a simple cross-platform code-logging library. 

Usage: 
  - import/include the LiveLog client class in your code
  - create an instance of LiveLog(String filename)
  - call the public method postToServer(String data-to-be-logged)
  - view updated code on web page
  
  

Development needs: 
  - Make clients for all programming languages
  - Add session-specific outputs (currently all users use the same log.txt -> confining us to 1 user)
